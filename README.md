## Name
EQUIPAY

## Description
Our product is EquiPay, a group expense tracker and splitter that automatically and conveniently splits bills, receipts, and costs among all involved participants equally or through manual weights. Instead of paying several group members, EquiPay will automatically split costs into one convenient payment to one group member ensuring all members' expenses have been settled. As such, the MVP involves a main page dashboard that tracks payments and allows users to settle payments.
